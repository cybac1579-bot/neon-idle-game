# Automated reference research (separate from manual development)

This file accumulates comparative design research for the **production/legacy** Neon Idle Game on `main`. It is not a manual development log and is not a specification for the separate reference redesign branch. Never clone another game's art, assets, exact skill tree or progression formula. Hard constraint: **no repeated tapping, rapid reactions, or mandatory active combat**; combat is automatic with optional low-frequency strategic choices.

**Observation:** Idle Slayer's ascension tree includes upgrades that permanently retain early unlocks/quests, plus distinct offline benefits; later ultra ascension can reset the ordinary ascension tree. Community reports note that repeated resets can feel burdensome, and the game favors active play in some phases. The useful transferable principle is **remove already-solved friction after a reset**, not copy its reset tiers or require tapping.

**Pros (impact):** (1) Permanent quality-of-life unlocks give resets a visible meaning (high); (2) preserving early automation reduces repetitive upgrade work (high); (3) a compact next-unlock preview communicates goals without cluttering combat (medium).

**Cons / risks (impact):** (1) too much persistence can trivialize early stages and boss encounters (high); (2) another meta-currency/tree adds cognitive/UI cost (medium-high); (3) copying active-play incentives violates the mobile idle constraint (critical).

**Application cost:** low-medium for a read-only post-rebirth summary and unlock-preview using existing state; medium-high for new persistent upgrade effects, save migration, and balance simulation.

**Decision:** **Apply selectively in a later implementation**: prefer a compact post-rebirth summary of retained benefits and next unlock on a separate growth/details surface, not a new combat button. **Defer** new prestige currency, forced activity, and permanent boss-skipping until 30-minute new-save and post-rebirth pacing are validated. Existing boss-stop rule must remain intact. No gameplay change made from this research in this run.

**Testable next step:** measure first/second rebirth purchase counts, time to next meaningful unlock, and whether an informational summary can reuse existing state without a save schema change. Validate on portrait UI and actual device before claiming improved feel.
